13. What are the advantages of using React over other frameworks or libraries like Angular or Vue?

React offers several advantages, including:

Component-based architecture: Encourages reusability and maintainability of UI components.
Virtual DOM: React uses a virtual DOM to efficiently update and render the UI, leading to faster performance.
Unidirectional data flow: This makes debugging and testing easier since data flows in one direction, reducing complexity.
Large ecosystem and community: React has extensive documentation, libraries, and community support.
Flexibility: React is often considered a library for building UI, while Angular and Vue are more complete frameworks, which can be an advantage for developers who prefer flexibility in how they structure applications.

14. What is the significance of key props in React lists?

The key prop helps React identify which items have changed, been added, or removed in a list of elements. By using a unique key for each list item, React can optimize rendering by only re-rendering the items that have changed, improving performance.

15. What is a "functional component" and how does it differ from a "class component"?

Functional components are simple functions that accept props and return React elements. They can use React hooks like useState, useEffect, etc., for state and lifecycle management.
Class components are ES6 classes that extend React.Component and have a render() method to return React elements. They can also manage state and lifecycle methods.
Functional components are typically simpler and more concise, whereas class components are more complex but were traditionally used for state and lifecycle management before hooks were introduced.

16. What are useEffect and its use cases in functional components?

useEffect is a hook that allows you to perform side effects in functional components. It can be used to handle tasks like:

Fetching data from an API
Manipulating the DOM
Setting up subscriptions or event listeners
Running code after the component renders
It runs after every render by default, but you can control when it runs by passing a dependency array as the second argument.

Example:

useEffect(() => {
  console.log('Component mounted or updated');
  return () => {
    console.log('Cleanup on unmount');
  };
}, [count]);  // Runs only when `count` changes


17. What is React Context, and when would you use it?

React Context is a way to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level. It’s typically used when certain data needs to be available to many components in an application (e.g., theme, authentication status).

Use Context when:

You have global data that needs to be accessed by many components (e.g., theme, user information).
You want to avoid prop drilling (passing props through many layers of components).

18. What are PropTypes in React, and why are they used?

PropTypes is a library that helps validate the types of props passed to a component. It ensures that the right type of data is passed to a component, helping catch bugs early and improving code reliability. You can define the expected data types for props and warn if the passed data does not match the expected type.

Example:

import PropTypes from 'prop-types';

function Greeting({ name }) {
  return <h1>Hello, {name}!</h1>;
}

Greeting.propTypes = {
  name: PropTypes.string.isRequired,
};


19. What is the useRef hook in React?

useRef is a hook that allows you to create a reference to a DOM element or a mutable value that persists across renders. Unlike state, updating the useRef does not cause the component to re-render.

Common Use Cases:

Accessing DOM elements (e.g., focusing an input field).
Storing mutable values that don’t require a re-render when changed.
Example:

const inputRef = useRef();

const focusInput = () => {
  inputRef.current.focus();
};

return <input ref={inputRef} />;


20. What are "pure" components in React?

A PureComponent is a type of class component that implements shouldComponentUpdate() with a shallow prop and state comparison. It prevents unnecessary re-renders by comparing the previous and next props and state, and if there are no changes, it skips the rendering process. This is useful for optimizing performance in large applications.

Example:

class MyComponent extends React.PureComponent {
  render() {
    return <div>{this.props.name}</div>;
  }
}
21. How would you handle events in React?
Answer:
In React, events are handled using camelCase syntax, and you pass an event handler function to the corresponding event. React event handlers are written in a way that they receive a synthetic event (cross-browser wrapper for native events).

Example:

function handleClick() {
  alert('Button clicked!');
}

function App() {
  return <button onClick={handleClick}>Click me</button>;
}


22. What are the advantages of using React Hooks over class components?

Simpler and cleaner code: Hooks make it easier to manage state and side effects in functional components, resulting in more concise code.
No need for this binding: Hooks eliminate the need for binding methods in class components.
Reusability: With hooks, you can create custom hooks to reuse logic across different components.
Better separation of concerns: Hooks allow you to separate logic by features instead of lifecycle methods, leading to cleaner and more modular code.


23. What are some performance optimization techniques in React?

React.memo: A higher-order component that prevents re-renders of functional components when props haven’t changed.
Code splitting: Using dynamic import() to load parts of the app only when needed.
useMemo: Memoizes expensive calculations so they are not recalculated on every render.
useCallback: Memoizes callback functions to prevent unnecessary re-creations.
Lazy loading components: Using React.lazy() and Suspense to load components lazily and improve initial load time.

24. What is the difference between componentDidMount() and useEffect() in React?

componentDidMount(): A lifecycle method used in class components. It is called once after the component is initially rendered.
useEffect(): A hook in functional components that can mimic componentDidMount() behavior and much more. It runs after every render unless the dependency array is provided, in which case it runs only when the dependencies change.

25. How do you handle forms in React?

Forms in React can be handled using either controlled or uncontrolled components:

Controlled components: Form data is managed by React’s state and is updated using onChange event handlers.
Uncontrolled components: Form data is handled by the DOM itself, and you access the form data using useRef or createRef.
Example of controlled form:

const Form = () => {
  const [inputValue, setInputValue] = useState('');

  const handleChange = (e) => {
    setInputValue(e.target.value);
  };

  const handleSubmit = (e) => {
    e.preventDefault();
    alert('Form submitted with: ' + inputValue);
  };

  return (
    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
      <input type="text" value={inputValue} onChange={handleChange} />
      <button type="submit">Submit</button>
    </form>
  );
};

26. What is the difference between setState and useState in React?

setState: This is used in class components to update the state. It merges the new state with the existing state and triggers a re-render of the component.
useState: This is a hook used in functional components to declare state variables. It returns an array with the current state value and a function to update it.

27. Explain error boundaries in React.

Error boundaries are React components that catch JavaScript errors anywhere in their child component tree, log those errors, and display a fallback UI. They help prevent the entire app from crashing due to errors in a part of the component tree.

Example:

class ErrorBoundary extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = { hasError: false };
  }

  static getDerivedStateFromError(error) {
    return { hasError: true };
  }

  componentDidCatch(error, info) {
    console.log(error, info);
  }

  render() {
    if (this.state.hasError) {
      return <h1>Something went wrong!</h1>;
    }
    return this.props.children;
  }
}
