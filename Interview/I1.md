1. What is ReactJS, and why would you use it in a web application?

ReactJS is an open-source JavaScript library for building user interfaces, primarily for single-page applications where you need a dynamic and responsive UI. React allows developers to create large web applications that can update and render efficiently in response to data changes. It uses a virtual DOM to optimize updates and improve performance. We use React because it’s component-based, reusable, and has a large community with extensive support.

2. What are components in React?

Components are the building blocks of a React application. A component is a JavaScript function or class that optionally accepts inputs (known as "props") and returns a React element that describes how a UI should appear. Components can be functional or class-based. React encourages reusable and modular UI elements, making development and maintenance easier.

3. What is JSX in React?

JSX stands for JavaScript XML, and it is a syntax extension for JavaScript used in React. JSX allows you to write HTML-like code within JavaScript, making it easier to create elements and components. Although React elements are represented as JavaScript objects, JSX provides a cleaner and more readable syntax. Under the hood, JSX is transpired into JavaScript React.createElement() calls.

Example:

const element = <h1>Hello, world!</h1>;

4. What is the Virtual DOM, and how does it work in React?

The Virtual DOM (VDOM) is an in-memory representation of the real DOM elements. React creates a virtual representation of the UI in memory, and whenever there’s a change in state or props, React updates the Virtual DOM first. Then, it compares the current VDOM with a snapshot of the previous VDOM using a process called "reconciliation." After that, it updates only the parts of the real DOM that have changed, which leads to better performance.

5. Explain the difference between state and props in React.

Props (short for properties) are used to pass data from a parent component to a child component. Props are immutable, meaning they cannot be changed by the child component; they are read-only.

State is used to manage data that can change over time and affect the rendering of a component. State is local to the component, and unlike props, it is mutable and can be updated using the setState() method.

Example:

// Props Example
function Greeting(props) {
  return <h1>Hello, {props.name}!</h1>;
}

// State Example
class Counter extends React.Component {
  constructor() {
    super();
    this.state = { count: 0 };
  }

  increment = () => {
    this.setState({ count: this.state.count + 1 });
  };

  render() {
    return <div>Count: {this.state.count}</div>;
  }
}


6. What are lifecycle methods in React? Can you name a few?

Lifecycle methods are special methods in a class component that are invoked at different stages of the component's existence, like mounting, updating, and unmounting. Some common lifecycle methods are:

componentDidMount(): Called once, immediately after the component is added to the DOM.
componentDidUpdate(): Called after the component is re-rendered, used to handle side effects.
componentWillUnmount(): Called before the component is removed from the DOM.
shouldComponentUpdate(): Determines if a component should re-render after receiving new props or state.

7. What is the difference between a controlled and uncontrolled component?

Controlled components are React components where form data (like input fields) is managed by the React component itself using state. The value of the input is controlled by the state, and any change is handled by an event handler.

Uncontrolled components are form elements where React does not manage the form data. Instead, the DOM itself keeps track of the input values, and references are used to access and manipulate them.

Controlled Example:

function ControlledInput() {
  const [value, setValue] = useState('');
  
  return <input type="text" value={value} onChange={(e) => setValue(e.target.value)} />;
}

Uncontrolled Example:

function UncontrolledInput() {
  const inputRef = useRef();
  
  const handleSubmit = () => {
    alert('Value: ' + inputRef.current.value);
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <input ref={inputRef} type="text" />
      <button onClick={handleSubmit}>Submit</button>
    </div>
  );
}


8. What are hooks in React?

Hooks are functions that allow you to use state and other React features without writing a class component. The most common hooks are:

useState: Allows you to add state to functional components.
useEffect: Performs side effects in function components, like fetching data or manipulating the DOM.
useContext: Allows you to access context values in functional components.
useRef: Creates mutable references that persist across renders.

Example:

const Counter = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  
  useEffect(() => {
    document.title = `Count: ${count}`;
  }, [count]);

  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>
      <p>Count: {count}</p>
    </div>
  );
};


9. What is React Router, and why do we need it?

React Router is a library that enables navigation among views in a React application. It allows us to create single-page applications (SPAs) where the page doesn't reload when navigating between components. React Router uses the browser’s history API to keep the UI in sync with the URL. It’s used for managing routes in React applications.

Basic Example:

import { BrowserRouter as Router, Route, Link } from 'react-router-dom';

function App() {
  return (
    <Router>
      <nav>
        <Link to="/">Home</Link>
        <Link to="/about">About</Link>
      </nav>
      
      <Route path="/" exact component={Home} />
      <Route path="/about" component={About} />
    </Router>
  );
}


10. What is the purpose of keys in React lists?

Keys in React are unique identifiers used to help React identify which items in a list are changed, added, or removed. They improve performance by enabling React to efficiently update and render only the necessary items when the list changes. Keys should be stable, predictable, and unique among siblings.

Example:

const items = ['Apple', 'Banana', 'Orange'];

function FruitList() {
  return (
    <ul>
      {items.map((item, index) => (
        <li key={index}>{item}</li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  );
}


11. What are higher-order components (HOCs) in React?

A Higher-Order Component is a function that takes a component and returns a new component with additional props or behavior. HOCs are used to share common functionality between components, such as logging, authentication, etc., without modifying the original component.

Example:

function withLogger(WrappedComponent) {
  return function(props) {
    console.log('Component rendered');
    return <WrappedComponent {...props} />;
  };
}

const Button = () => <button>Click me</button>;

const ButtonWithLogger = withLogger(Button);


12. Can you explain the concept of "lifting state up" in React?

"Lifting state up" refers to moving state to the closest common ancestor of components that need to access or modify it. Instead of managing state within each individual component, we lift the state to a parent component and pass it down as props to the child components. This ensures that data is shared correctly between components.
